## Create a Family Tree

To create a family tree, use the following endpoint.

| Method | URI | Headers |
| :- |   :-   |  :-  |
| PUT | `families/{family.id}/tree` | Default |

### Body

Because of the recursive nature of the family trees, they work differently than the rest of the entities in Kanka, a tree consists of an array of nodes which in turn can contain an array of child nodes, for offsprings, and relation nodes.

A family tree has to have a parent node, which in turn contains an array with with its related nodes, this nodes can have their respective relations arrays and child arrays, that also contain nodes.

Its worth noting that children can only come from a relation, meaning that only relation nodes can have children arrays, and that only the founder and children can have relations, meaning that only the founder and children nodes can have relations.

| Parameter | Type | Detail |
| :- |   :-   |  :-  |
| `tree` | `array` (Required) | Array containing all the nodes for the family tree|
| `*.entity_id` | `int` (Required) | The id of the entity represented by the node |
| `*.uuid` | `string` (Required) | A string that identifies the node, this can be left empty or filled with a string, but the array key is required |
| `*.role` | `string` | The relation role of the node |
| `*.colour` | `string` | The hex value of the node's colour |
| `*.cssClass` | `string` | The CSS class for the node |
| `*.visibility` | `integer` | The visibility id for the node, 1 for all, 2 for admins, 3 for admins and self, 4 for self, 5 for campaign members, note that the visibility of the node also applies to all its descendant relations and children |
| `*.isUnknown` | `bool` | If the node shows "Unknown" instead of its entity |
| `*.relations` | `array` (Exclusive to children/founder nodes) | Array containing a node's related nodes |
| `*.children` | `array` (Exclusive to relation nodes) | Array containing the child nodes of a relation |
