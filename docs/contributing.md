# ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for wanting to contribute

First off, thank you for your interest in helping improve Kanka! While we're a small team and can't review external code contributions or manage pull requests at this time, there are still plenty of valuable ways you can make a difference.

## ü§ù How you can help

We're always looking for passionate community members to lend a hand in ways that truly matter:

* **Help with user documentation**: If you're good at explaining things or spot missing information in our [documentation](https://docs.kanka.io), jump into the [Kanka Discord](http://kanka.io/go/discord) and let us know!

* **Onboard new users**: Welcome new members in the [Discord](http://kanka.io/go/discord) and help answer questions. Your experience can make a big difference in someone‚Äôs journey.

* **Report translation errors**: If you see typos or weird phrasing in translated content, we‚Äôd love to hear about it on [Discord](http://kanka.io/go/discord) so we can fix it.

## ‚õî No external code contributions

As much as we appreciate the spirit of open-source collaboration, our team doesn't currently have the bandwidth to manage pull requests or integrate external code contributions. We're focused on building and maintaining features internally to ensure a consistent experience for all users.
